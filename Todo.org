- [ ] File saving and manipulating
  - The entrypoint command...
    - opens the buffer
    - then sets the buffer variable with what you entered
    - then calls load which loads the config using the buffer you just set
  - might want to save it
  - somehow set a buffer local variable in the command
  - or want a new one
  - support instances
  - Look up...
    - buftype
    - bufhidden
    - buflisted
  - use a buffer local variable for the type
  - 2 cases
    - opening up a new file
      - do full reload, dont care about buffer
      - BufNewFile
    - opening a file that already exists
      - reload the functions (behind the scenes), not the text
      - BufRead
    - command that outputs the data to a file of your choice
