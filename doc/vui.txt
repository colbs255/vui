*vui.txt* A wrapper interface that makes command line tools more convenient to use

Maps                                                                 *vui-maps*
===============================================================================
Each mapping can be overridden with the corresponding `<Plug>` mapping.
For example, `nmap <localleader><CR> <Plug>(vui-execute-command)`
would run `VUIExecuteCommand` when localleader followed by enter is pressed.

                                                                    *vui_enter*
enter               Delete the arg value in the current line, go into
                    insert mode and activate autocomplete.
